* the project dir: housing. 
* I have created an app named `user`, where we write codes for user login and register (user story 1 & 2)
* to add new features, please run `django-admin startapp <appname>`. 
* please run `python manage.py runserver` in the housing dir, and then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/register/ and http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the current register page and home page.
